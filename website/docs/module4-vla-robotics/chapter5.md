# Chapter 5 — Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid

This capstone project integrates all concepts learned in the module to create an autonomous humanoid robot.

## Topics:
- Full VLA pipeline implementation: Voice command → LLM planning → ROS 2 execution → Navigation → Object interaction.
- Testing multi-step tasks with obstacle avoidance.
- Deliverables: Simulation log, task success report, annotated action sequence, and performance evaluation.

## Project:
Demonstrate an autonomous humanoid performing a multi-step task in simulation.
