# Chapter 2: Gazebo Physics Simulation

This chapter will detail how to set up a Gazebo world for simulating robot dynamics, including gravity, collisions, and other physics-based interactions.

## Mini-Lab: Simulating a Simple Humanoid Arm

In this mini-lab, you will load the `simple_humanoid_arm.urdf` into Gazebo and observe its behavior under gravity. You will also learn how to apply simple forces to simulate movement.
