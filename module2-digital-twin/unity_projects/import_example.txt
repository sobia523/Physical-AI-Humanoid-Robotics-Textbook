This file serves as a placeholder for Unity project assets related to importing robots and environments.
Detailed steps for creating and configuring these assets can be found in Chapter 3: Unity for High-Fidelity Rendering (module2-digital-twin/content/chapter3.md).

To develop this example:
1. Open the Unity project located in this directory (`module2-digital-twin/unity_projects/`) with Unity Editor.
2. Follow the instructions in Chapter 3 to import a robot model and an environment.
3. Save the Unity scene and relevant assets.
