# Contracts for Fix Broken Routes & Enable Working Search in Docusaurus v3

This feature primarily involves fixing existing routing and integrating an official Docusaurus search solution. As such, no new external API contracts are being defined or modified. The "contracts" are implicitly handled by Docusaurus's internal routing mechanisms and the chosen official search plugin's configuration and data expectations.
