**Branch**: `001-isaac-ai-robot-brain` | **Date**: 2025-12-12 | **Spec**: [specs/001-isaac-ai-robot-brain/spec.md](specs/001-isaac-ai-robot-brain/spec.md)
**Purpose**: To define the key entities and their relationships relevant to the AI-Robot Brain module, focusing on concepts rather than database schemas.

## Key Entities

### 1. Humanoid Robot

*   **Description**: A simulated bipedal robot model used within Isaac Sim. It serves as the primary agent for perception, navigation, and interaction within the simulated environment.
*   **Attributes**:
    *   `joints`: Controllable degrees of freedom, allowing for articulation (e.g., arm, leg movements).
    *   `sensors`: Attached virtual sensors (e.g., LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, IMUs) that provide environmental data.
    *   `pose`: Current position and orientation in the simulation environment.
    *   `velocity`: Linear and angular velocities.
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Generates `Synthetic Sensor Data`.
    *   Is controlled by `Navigation Stack (Nav2)` commands.
    *   Its `pose` and `velocity` are estimated by the `VSLAM Pipeline`.

### 2. Isaac Sim Environment

*   **Description**: The 3D photorealistic simulation environment provided by NVIDIA Isaac Sim, where the humanoid robot operates. It includes static and dynamic objects, terrains, and lighting.
*   **Attributes**:
    *   `assets`: 3D models of robots, objects, and terrain (e.g., USD files).
    *   `lighting`: Environmental lighting conditions.
    *   `physics_engine`: Underlying physics simulation parameters.
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Contains `Humanoid Robot` instances and `Obstacles`.
    *   Source of ground truth for `VSLAM Pipeline` evaluation.

### 3. Synthetic Sensor Data

*   **Description**: Data generated by virtual sensors attached to the `Humanoid Robot` within the `Isaac Sim Environment`. This data mimics real-world sensor outputs but can be perfectly labeled.
*   **Types**:
    *   `LiDAR scans`: Point cloud data representing distances to surfaces.
    *   `RGB-D images`: Color images combined with depth information (RGB and Depth).
    *   `IMU data`: Inertial Measurement Unit data (acceleration, angular velocity).
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Generated by `Humanoid Robot`'s `sensors` in `Isaac Sim Environment`.
    *   Input to `VSLAM Pipeline`.

### 4. VSLAM Pipeline

*   **Description**: A software system (primarily using Isaac ROS components) that processes `Synthetic Sensor Data` (e.g., RGB-D images) to simultaneously estimate the `Humanoid Robot`'s `pose` and build a map of its surroundings.
*   **Inputs**: `Synthetic Sensor Data` (RGB-D, IMU).
*   **Outputs**:
    *   `Estimated Robot Pose`: Real-time estimation of robot's position and orientation.
    *   `Occupancy Map` or `Point Cloud Map`: Representation of the environment.
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Consumes `Synthetic Sensor Data`.
    *   Provides `Estimated Robot Pose` to `Navigation Stack (Nav2)`.
    *   Generates `Map` of the `Isaac Sim Environment`.

### 5. Navigation Stack (Nav2)

*   **Description**: A ROS 2-based software framework for autonomous mobile robot navigation. It takes a target `Waypoint` and the robot's `Estimated Robot Pose` to plan and execute a path while avoiding `Obstacles`.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `Estimated Robot Pose` (from `VSLAM Pipeline`).
    *   `Target Waypoint`.
    *   `Map` (from `VSLAM Pipeline`).
*   **Outputs**:
    *   `Velocity Commands`: Control signals sent to the `Humanoid Robot`'s joints.
    *   `Planned Path`: A sequence of poses leading to the target.
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Receives `Estimated Robot Pose` from `VSLAM Pipeline`.
    *   Sends `Velocity Commands` to `Humanoid Robot`.
    *   Uses `Map` of the `Isaac Sim Environment`.

### 6. Waypoint

*   **Description**: A target location (position and orientation) in the `Isaac Sim Environment` that the `Humanoid Robot` is commanded to reach.
*   **Attributes**:
    *   `position`: X, Y, Z coordinates.
    *   `orientation`: Roll, Pitch, Yaw or Quaternion.
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Input to `Navigation Stack (Nav2)`.

### 7. Obstacle

*   **Description**: Static or dynamic objects present in the `Isaac Sim Environment` that the `Humanoid Robot` must detect and avoid during navigation.
*   **Attributes**:
    *   `geometry`: Shape and size.
    *   `pose`: Position and orientation.
    *   `type`: Static, dynamic.
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Present in `Isaac Sim Environment`.
    *   Detected via `Synthetic Sensor Data`.
    *   Avoided by `Navigation Stack (Nav2)`.

### 8. Lab Report

*   **Description**: A document summarizing the results of experiments and micro-projects, including visualizations and analysis.
*   **Contents**:
    *   `Maps`: Generated by `VSLAM Pipeline`.
    *   `Sensor Data Plots`: Visualizations of `Synthetic Sensor Data`.
    *   `Trajectory Visualization`: Plot of the `Humanoid Robot`'s path.
*   **Relationships**:
    *   Contains outputs from `VSLAM Pipeline` and `Navigation Stack (Nav2)`.
