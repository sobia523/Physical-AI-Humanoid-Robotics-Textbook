# Contracts for Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This feature focuses on creating educational content and simulations using Gazebo, Unity, and ROS 2. As such, there are no new external API contracts being defined or modified. The "contracts" are implicitly handled by the interfaces and conventions of these simulation and robotics frameworks.
