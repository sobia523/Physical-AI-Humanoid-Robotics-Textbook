# API Contracts (Not Applicable)

This `contracts/` directory is part of the standard Spec-Kit Plus planning workflow. However, for the "Digital Twin Module" (Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook), the primary output is educational content, code examples, and simulation configurations, not a software application exposing APIs.

Therefore, no API contracts are generated for this feature.
