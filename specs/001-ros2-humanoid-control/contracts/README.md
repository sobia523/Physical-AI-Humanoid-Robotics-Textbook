# Contracts: ROS 2 Humanoid Control Module

**Branch**: `001-ros2-humanoid-control` | **Date**: 2025-12-11 | **Spec**: `specs/001-ros2-humanoid-control/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification and implementation plan for the ROS 2 Humanoid Control Module.

## Overview

This module focuses on teaching and demonstrating the use of existing ROS 2 communication mechanisms (topics, services, actions) and URDF for humanoid robot control. It does not involve the creation of new external APIs or contracts in the traditional software engineering sense (e.g., REST API endpoints, GraphQL schemas).

The "contracts" within this module are primarily the established ROS 2 message definitions, service types, and action protocols used for inter-node communication, as well as the URDF specification itself. These are external standards and existing definitions that the module aims to explain and utilize, not create.

## No New API Contracts Generated

Given the nature of this educational content, there are no new API contracts to be generated by this planning phase. The module will leverage and explain existing ROS 2 and URDF specifications.
