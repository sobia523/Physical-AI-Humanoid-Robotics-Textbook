# Placeholder for Humanoid Robot USD Model

This file should contain the USD (Universal Scene Description) definition for a basic humanoid robot.
It would typically include:
- Geometry for the robot links
- Joint definitions for articulation
- Material properties for rendering
- Attachment points for sensors

**Note**: Replace this content with an actual USD model file for a humanoid robot, compatible with NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
