# Placeholder for Basic Isaac Sim Environment USD Model

This file should contain the USD (Universal Scene Description) definition for a basic simulation environment.
It would typically include:
- Ground plane or basic terrain
- Static obstacles (walls, blocks)
- Lighting setup
- Material properties for rendering

**Note**: Replace this content with an actual USD model file for a basic Isaac Sim environment.
