# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This module focuses on teaching students to develop advanced perception, navigation, and AI-driven humanoid control using NVIDIA Isaac tools, specifically Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. It covers photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, VSLAM (Visual SLAM), and Nav2 path planning for bipedal robots, ultimately bridging perception, planning, and action pipelines.
