## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for the 'Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics' feature. The file contains a total of 25 tasks, organized into 6 phases, including setup, foundational components, and tasks for each of the 3 user stories.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, actionable task list for implementing the VLA robotics module.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/004-vla-robotics-module/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement`
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process was smooth. The design documents provided all the necessary information to create a comprehensive task list. The phased approach based on user stories will allow for incremental development and testing.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
