# Chapter 3 — Cognitive Planning with LLMs

This chapter focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for cognitive planning in robotics.

## Topics:
- Translating natural language instructions into sequential ROS 2 actions.
- Generating task plans for humanoid manipulation and navigation.
- Integrating LLM outputs with ROS 2.

## Hands-on:
Convert the command "Pick up the box and move it to the table" into an action sequence generated by the cognitive planner.
