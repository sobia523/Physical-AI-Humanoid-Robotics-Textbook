# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics

This module teaches students how to integrate large language models (LLMs) with robotics for autonomous humanoid control from voice commands.

## Environment Setup

### OpenAI API Key

To use the OpenAI LLM for cognitive planning, you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.

On Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

On Linux/macOS:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
